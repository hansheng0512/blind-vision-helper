# TensorFlow Lite Python object detection example with Raspberry Pi

## Set up the Raspberry Pi
```angular2html
sudo sh setup.sh
```

## Run the detector

```
python3 detect.py --model efficientdet_lite0.tflite
```

You should see the camera feed appear on the monitor attached to your Raspberry
Pi. Put some objects in front of the camera, like a coffee mug or keyboard, and
you'll see boxes drawn around those that the model recognizes, including the
label and score for each. It also prints the number of frames per second (FPS)
at the top-left corner of the screen. As the pipeline contains some processes
other than model inference, including visualizing the detection results, you can
expect a higher FPS if your inference pipeline runs in headless mode without
visualization.

For more information about executing inferences with TensorFlow Lite, read
[TensorFlow Lite inference](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference).

## Speed up model inference (optional)

If you want to significantly speed up the inference time, you can attach an
[Coral USB Accelerator](https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/accelerator)—a USB
accessory that adds the
[Edge TPU ML accelerator](https://coral.withgoogle.com/docs/edgetpu/faq/) to any
Linux-based system.

If you have a Coral USB Accelerator, you can run the sample with it enabled:

1.  First, be sure you have completed the
    [USB Accelerator setup instructions](https://coral.withgoogle.com/docs/accelerator/get-started/).

2.  Run the object detection script using the EdgeTPU TFLite model and enable
    the EdgeTPU option. Be noted that the EdgeTPU requires a specific TFLite
    model that is different from the one used above.

```
python3 detect.py \
  --enableEdgeTPU
  --model efficientdet_lite0_edgetpu.tflite
```

You should see significantly faster inference speeds.
